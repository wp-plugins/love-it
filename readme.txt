Love It is a simple plugin that adds a "Love It" link to your posts, pages, and custom post types. Show your most popular items in a widget.

== Description ==

Love It is a simple plugin that adds a "Love It" link to your posts, pages, and custom post types. It works similar to Facebook's Like button, but is exclusive to your website. It provides a great way for users to show their appreciation, and for you to gain a good idea of which posts are your most popular.

The plugin includes a simple widget to show your "Most Loved" items.

This plugin is based of the tutorial I published on [creating a simple Love It plugin]: http://pippinsplugins.com/write-a-love-it-plugin-with-ajax/

The demonstration video for the tutorial and the plugin is below:
